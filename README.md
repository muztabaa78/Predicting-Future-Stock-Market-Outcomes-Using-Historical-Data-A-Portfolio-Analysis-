## 📚 Methodology

### Return Calculation
- Daily returns: (Current Price - Previous Price) / Previous Price
- Annual returns: (Year-End Price - Year-Start Price) / Year-Start Price
- CAGR: (Ending Value / Beginning Value)^(1/n) - 1

### Risk Measurement
- Standard Deviation: √(Variance of returns)
- Beta: Covariance(Stock, Market) / Variance(Market)
- Correlation: Measure of co-movement between stocks

### Portfolio Optimization
- Efficient Frontier: All possible portfolios with maximum return per unit of risk
- Optimal Portfolio: Maximum Sharpe ratio or minimum variance
- Constraints: Diversification, sector allocation, risk limits
